# A Quick Tutorial to Learn the Basics of ReactJS

### The Project

ReactJS is a JavaScript library meant to provide an easy-to-use toolkit to set up small web applications quickly.

This repository is a simple template that contains the raw material for a ReactJS web app: the Sci-Fi Browser. This mini-project aims at helping people grasp the core concepts of ReactJS. By going through the tutorial (provided in the repo in PDF format), you will build an app brick by brick until you eventually have a simple list of sci-fi books you can browse and get details on.

### Setting up the Project

ReactJS relies on the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) tool. Before diving into the Sci-Fi Browser, make sure you have NodeJS installed so that you can use the `npm` or `npx` commands.

Then to start the project, simply clone the Github repo, and follow the instructions in the tutorial.
